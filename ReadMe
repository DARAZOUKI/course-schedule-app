# Course Schedule App

## Description
This Angular application fetches course schedule data from a web service and presents it in a tabular format on the web page. Users can sort the data by course code, course name, and progression. Additionally, users can search/filter the data by entering a search term in the input field.

## Task Description
The task was to create an Angular application that communicates with a web service to fetch course schedule data. The application should display the data in a table format and allow users to sort and filter the data dynamically without reloading the page. Key requirements included:
- Fetching course schedule data from a web service using HttpClient
- Displaying the data in a table with columns for course code, course name, and progression
- Implementing sorting functionality for course code, course name, and progression
- Implementing filtering functionality to search/filter courses by course code or course name
- Updating the user interface dynamically in response to sorting and filtering actions

## Technologies Used
- Angular: Front-end framework for building single-page web applications
- TypeScript: Programming language for building Angular applications
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring and styling web pages
- HttpClient: Angular module for making HTTP requests
- RxJS: Library for reactive programming used for handling asynchronous operations.

## Structure

- `src/app/course-schedule.model.ts`: Contains data model inteface (Course).
- `src/app/assets`: Contains static assets such as images or CSS files
- `src/app/app.module.ts`: Angular module file where components, services, and other modules are declared
- `src/app/courseSchedule/courseSchedule.component.html`: HTML template file for the course schedule component
